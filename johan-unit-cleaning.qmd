## Goals of this notebook

What we'll do to prepare the data:

- Download the data
- Import it into our notebook
- Clean up data types and columns 
- Export data into our next notebook

## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

## Downloading data

This data comes from a public information request to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.

```{r}
indoor_temps <- read_csv("data-raw/Indoor-30days-edited.csv")

indoor_temps |> glimpse()
```

```{r}
other_indoor_temps <- read_csv("data-raw/Indoor-31days-edited.csv")

other_indoor_temps |> glimpse()
```

## Pivot Longer

Right now each day is a column, let's change it so days are all under one column and clean up the names of our columns.

We'll do this individually before we join the columns so we don't have to remove the 31st rows for months with only 30 days.

```{r}
other_temps_raw <- other_indoor_temps |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = "1":"31",
    names_to = "day",
    values_to = "temperature"
  )

other_temps_raw
```

```{r}
indoor_temps_raw <- indoor_temps |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = "1":"30",
    names_to = "day",
    values_to = "temperature"
  )

indoor_temps_raw
```

## Combine data frames

Let's combine both of our datasets to make a single table.

```{r}
indoor_temps_combined <- bind_rows(other_temps_raw, indoor_temps_raw)

indoor_temps_combined
```

## Clean names

One column we'll have to convert is our file_name column into a month/year column. In order to do that, we first have to create a value with all of the characters we want to remove.

```{r}
word_list <- c("SB1R56 - |_1.pdf|_2.pdf")
```

Now that we've done that, let's clean names and make our new column.

```{r}
daily_indoor <- indoor_temps_combined|> 
  clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    month = str_remove_all(file_name, word_list) 
  ) 

daily_indoor
```

## Add date column

We'll need to clean up the dates so they're standardized and readable. We'll combine our month/year column with the day column to put through the lubridate function and, while we're at it, remove unnecessary columns.

```{r}
indoor_units_clean <- daily_indoor |> 
    unite(
    col = "temp_date", 
    day, month,
    sep = " "
    ) |> 
  mutate(
    date = dmy(temp_date)
  ) |> 
  select(!c(file_name, validation_link, temp_date))

indoor_units_clean
```

## Export the data

We did it! Now let's export our data and place it in our processed data folder.

```{r}
indoor_units_clean |> write_rds("data-processed/01-heat-all.rds")
```
